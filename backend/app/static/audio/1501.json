And there's also places for you to sit and just enjoy the view. Todd: Oh, nice. A roof garden, I like that. Katie: It's really nice. Todd: Now, do you buy clothes at the mall? Do they have nice clothing shops? Katie: Yeah, they have nice clothing shops. Some of them are a little bit expensive. Todd: Ah, yeah. Katie: And I like buying cheap clothes. Todd: Okay.

It's hard to walk around. Todd: Yeah, and we're teachers, we teach kids all day. Katie: Mm-hmm. Todd: Okay. I don't want to go then. Katie: No, me neither.
