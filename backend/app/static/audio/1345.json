{"level":"A1","script":"Josh: Hey, Shirley. Shirley: Hey, Josh. Josh: So how was your weekend? Shirley: Hmm, quite busy this weekend. Josh: Really? Those are hard. Shirley: Yeah. Josh: So what did you do on Saturday? Shirley: Well, Saturday morning, I usually clean the house. Josh: Okay. Shirley: Yeah. It’s kind of boring, but I have to clean the bathroom and then the kitchen, and then the lounge room because I have lots of cats. And the cats leave hair everywhere. So I always have to clean on Saturday mornings. Josh: Yes, cats are messy. Shirley: Yeah. Josh: So after you cleaned, what did you do? Shirley: Well, in the afternoon, I went for a walk up the mountain. It was a beautiful sunny day. There were no clouds in the sky. Josh: Wow. Shirley: It was gorgeous. So I walked up the mountain and I saw a ferret. Josh: A ferret? Shirley: Yeah. Josh: Wow. Shirley: They’re a little furry animal, four legs, tail—not like a rabbit, but about the same size as a rabbit. Josh: Okay. Shirley: And they’re kind of gold brown color. Josh: Wow, did you see any other animals on your walk? Shirley: No. I didn’t see any other animals on the ground. But I did see a beautiful bird flying in the sky. Josh: Wow. Do you know what kind? Shirley: I think it was an ibis. It’s a big bird that usually walks in the water. It has long legs and it was white with a black head. Josh: Great. So after your walk, did you do anything else? Shirley: I went home and then I watched some TV. Josh: Okay. Shirley: That was about it for my Saturday. Josh: Okay. What did you do on Sunday? Shirley: Sunday, I went to the art museum. Josh: Really? Shirley: Yeah. Josh: Great. Shirley: I really like to go and see new art; pictures or paintings or photographs or sometimes sculptures. Josh: Okay. So who’s your favorite artist? Shirley: I don’t really have a favorite artist but I really like watercolors, so pictures that are painted with just soft—a kind of soft painting style. Josh: Do you like paintings of nature? Shirley: I do like paintings of nature. I especially like paintings of flowers and animals and places that have water like lakes or rivers or the sea. Josh: Oh, that sounds like you had a great weekend. Shirley: Yeah, it was good. Thanks. Josh: Okay."}
