Todd: But these days, I often listen to books instead. I listen to audio books. Meg: Oh really? Todd: Yeah, I like listening to audio books. Meg: Why? Todd: Because I can exercise at the same time. Meg: So, exercising and reading at the same time. Todd: Yeah, it's fun. So, I love jogging and I go jogging almost every day, usually for one hour. I listen to audio books when I jog.

Do you like hiking? Todd: I do. I'm with you. I love hiking. What about things like rock climbing? Meg: I have never been rock climbing. Have you gone rock climbing?

Meg: I enjoy singing, but I'm not very good at it. So, I like singing when I'm alone or in my car. Are you good at singing? Todd: No, I'm terrible at singing. So, I hate singing. I really, really hate singing. But I like going to karaoke and listening to people sing. Meg: Yeah, some people are really good at singing. What about dancing? Todd: I hate dancing too. Yeah, I'm not good at dancing. So, dancing is very embarrassing for me. I don't like it. Meg: I'm not good at dancing either. Todd: Are there any other activities you really dislike doing? Like for me, I hate writing letters. For example, I don't like writing thank you letters. I don't like writing anything with my hand. Typing is okay. I don't mind typing things, but I hate writing. Meg: So, using your hand to write, you hate writing? Todd: Yeah, I like typing. Fingers is okay. Thumb is okay on the phone. I don't mind texting, I don't mind typing. I just don't like physically writing with a pencil or a pen. Meg: Yeah. Pen or a pencil, like writing a letter. Todd: Right. Because my writing is really bad, and it's hard to read. So, it's embarrassing. Meg: I'm sure it's fine. Todd: Yeah. How about you? For example, do you like iron in your clothes? Meg: I don't like having my clothes, but my clothes usually don't need ironing, so I don't have to worry about it too much. I don't like doing laundry. It's related to ironing clothes. So, it takes a long time. And the clothes, I have to dry the clothes. So, doing laundry is a little bit boring for me. Todd: I don't mind doing laundry if I go to the coin laundry, but I hate hanging my laundry out. I hate hanging out my laundry. It takes forever. I don't know why, you put it out, you take it back in, it just takes so much time. Meg: That's funny. I'm kind of the opposite. I don't mind hanging out my laundry, because I like saving money, so I don't have to use money at the coin laundry. Todd: Plus, you are helping the environment. Meg: That's true. I like helping the earth. Todd: Yeah, I should change. Okay. Thanks Meg. Meg: Yeah."}
